The flow helps in the coherence of the text. Linking words are important.

The text should help the reader, it has to be user friendly.

Working memory: For things that we use immediatly. The opposite is the long therm memory.

Short sentences doesn't mean a clear idea.

Full stop is when you breath. While you write, imagine that you're speaking.

Look for the formal connectives. People use it less than they should in academical texts.

In English they use pontuation much more than in Portuguese.

Most of the structures that take comma in Portuguese will take in English.

`In the other hand` pressuposes `in one hand` and after `in the other`: Por outro lado.

Nevertheless is very formal. Rarely is used oraly.

Although is used writing. Though, oraly.

The English terms `despite` and `in spite of` are synonyms. Despite might be a tiny bit more formal, but the two terms are interchangeable. Just be careful not to say something like "despite of" or "in despite" – it’s always either the three words in spite of, or just the single word despite.

* Depois de although usamos um sujeito + verbo.

* Depois de in spite of ou despite (apesar de), usamos um substantivo, um pronome (this/that/what etc.) ou a forma do gerúndio –ing. Despite tem o mesmo uso que in spite of, mas nunca leva o `of`. Pode-se também usar as formas “in spite of the fact (that)…” e “despite the fact (that)…”.

* Às vezes usa-se though em vez de although. Geralmente though vem no início da frase.

* No inglês falado, sempre se vê though no fim da frase, significando “but” ou “however”.

* Even though é uma forma mais enfática de although.
